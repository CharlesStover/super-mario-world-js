# Super Mario World Engine in JavaScript
Super Mario World JS was a project for a college-level Programming Paradigms course.

It implements a View-Model-Controller architecture with a redux-style Model that accepts actions that are fed through a reducer.

## Controls

_Ctrl_ creates a Fireball.

_Left_ and _Right_ move Mario left and right respectively.

_Mouse Click_ will create a tube at the click location.

_Space_ makes Mario jump.
